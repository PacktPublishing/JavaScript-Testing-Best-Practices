# JavaScript Testing Best Practices
This is the code repository for [JavaScript Testing Best Practices [Video]](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/JavaScript-Testing-Best-Practices), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
JavaScript brings vast amounts of freedom to both frontend and backend developers. However, that freedom comes at a cost: the need to continually screen your applications for bugs and possible optimizations. The presence of multiple testing frameworks such as Jasmine and Mocha confuses newcomers and experienced JavaScript devs when it comes to deciding which one is the best tool for the job.
In this course, you will delve into different aspects and specifics of JavaScript testing. You will enhance your skills by mastering many topics that have been a source of confusion in the past—such as integration testing, E2E testing, and Behavioral Driven Development. You will learn how to break down your code into systems that you can challenge individually in an isolated environment, thus catching bugs early before they reach production.
With the testing skills you've acquired, you will examine the most available testing frameworks and tools (including Jasmine, Mocha, Chai, and Jest) to find the one that suits you best. Having the right tool for the job will help you work with Test-Driven and Behavioral-Driven Development on all application layers.
